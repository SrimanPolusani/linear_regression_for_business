<h1>linear_regression_for_business</h1>
<p>This is a machine learning project used for predictions in businesses. The machine learning algorithm is built with Numpy from the scratch rather than using an external module like Scikit-learn. Data from txt file is converted to numpy array object using ',' delimiter. The object 'linear_regression_ml' has methods for finding cost, computing gradient and performing gradient descent. It can be used for making predictions with the final model and even testing the accuracy with matplotlib visualization. You can find the data in ex1data1.txt and ex1data2.txt files.</p>
<h3>This project is built using the following tools:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Frameworks & Modules: Numpy, Mathplotlib, Math</li>
  <li>Backend: Python 3</li>
</ol>
